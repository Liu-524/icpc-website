# **Petya and Strings**

You are asked to compare two strings, without distinguishing upper and lower cases. You may first convert all characters in both strings to upper case without affecting the result. Since the two strings are of same length, simply iterate through the index and report the result on the first occurrence of disagreement between the strings. Report zero if no difference is found. 

**Complexity:** O(\\(n\\))

**Sample Solution:** [petya.cpp]


# **Yound Physicists**

The sum vector is zero iff the sum of each component is zero. So the object is idle iff \\(\Sigma{x_i}, \Sigma{y_i}, Sigma{z_i}\\) are all zero. 

**Complexity:** O(\\(n\\))

**Sample Solution:** [physicist.cpp]

# **Way too long words**

If the word has <= 10 letters, print the string itself. Otherwise, print the first character, and then the length of input string minus 2, and then the last character. 

**Complexity:** O(\\(|S|\\))

**Sample Solution:** [words.cpp]
