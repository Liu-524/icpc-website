description: We will be holding an open programming contest with prizes!
---

This semester, we will be holding our first official programming contest open to the 
entire UIUC student body!

<br>

The SIG-ICPC Dropbox Open Programming Contest, or the Dropbox Open for short, is a 
5-hour, semi-ICPC-style contest open to all UIUC students eligible to participate in 
the 2015 Mid-Central Regionals contest. Full eligibility rules are available 
[here](/contest/rules.html#Eligibility). The contest will be on April 18th from 
10:30 AM to 6:00 PM, and is already visible on our [calendar](/calendar.html). 

<br>

Dropbox has provided over <b>$500</b> in prizes for the top teams! We are creating a 
completely brand new problem set for this competition, and we have worked to make 
the problems fun and challenging, but doable. We will also be providing dinner after 
the contest. (We know how much you love free food. =D)

<br>

Students can compete in teams of their own choosing of 3 students. Students who 
cannot find a team before the date of the contest will be matched to other students 
on a first-registered first-serve basis on the date of the competition. Unlike ICPC 
contests, we are allowing students to use their own computers (one per person) and 
have full access to any physical materials or online resources (except people 
outside your team) during the contest. Teams will be scored using the standard 
ICPC scoring rules.

<br>

If you are interested in registering for the contest (and you should all be 
interested), visit the [contest webpage](/contest/about.html). Registration is 
currently open at [this link](/contest/register.html)! (Google login required)

<br>

We have worked hard to make sure this will be a fun event for everyone. Invite 
your friends to participate and start forming your teams today!
