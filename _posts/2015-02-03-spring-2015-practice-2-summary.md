description: Summary of our first weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

At today's practice, we introduced SIG-ICPC and the ACM ICPC competition, in which we 
compete each year. The competition is structured into a Regionals competition in 
November and a World Finals competition around May. Only the top 3 teams in our 
region (at most 1 from UIUC) can advance to the World Finals competition each year. 
We take between 4 and 6 teams of 3 students each to Regionals each year, so we hold 
individual tryouts for the regionals teams in September.

<br/>

We also went over some sample problems and practiced a couple during the meeting. We 
first went through [Lampyridae Teleportae, Problem B from 2008's Mid-Central regional](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=334&page=show_problem&problem=2169) 
and discussed how to break down an ICPC problem and understand the requirements. We 
then practiced the following problems:

 * [Reverse Rot, Problem G from 2014's regional](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=662&page=show_problem&problem=4830)
 * [Word Cloud, Problem E from 2014's regional](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=662&page=show_problem&problem=4828)

</br>

NOTE: In order to practice these problems, you will need to [create an account](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=registers) 
on the ACM-ICPC Live Archive. To submit a solution for judging, click on the 'Submit' 
link in the top right hand corner of the page and copy-paste your code into the 
submission box (Java users will need to name their class 'Main'). Your program should 
use standard input/output.

<br/>

If you weren't able to finish solving the problems at the practice, we encourage you 
to attempt to get the problem correct on your own before looking for the official 
solutions. If you are getting stuck on a test case, try working out the example on 
paper to see if you can find the bug in your code or way of thinking.

<br/>

<b>IMPORTANT</b>: At the end of practice, we had everyone register for the 
[Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com), [University of Valladoid Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org), 
and [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/tc). Please make sure you register for all 
three of these online judges in addition to the ACM-ICPC Live Archive given above, 
as you will need accounts on these sites for the practices.

<br/>

<b>Once you have registered, please <i>add your username information [here](http://goo.gl/forms/s65PX7rPps)</i></b>.

<br/>

Next week, Mike Seo will be covering basic dynamic programming (DP) problems. The 
problemset is available in the Announcements section of the website, in [this](/announcements/2015/02/04/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-feb-03.html) 
post. Please attempt as many of these problems as you can on your own before coming 
to practice, as we will not be going over all of the problems there. Instead, at the 
practice, Mike will give a short overview of DP problems, go over a problem or two, 
and answer any questions you may have. You can also use the practice time to discuss 
solutions with other SIG-ICPC members.

<br/>

We look forward to seeing everyone at next week's meeting. Until then, <i>happy 
coding</i>!
