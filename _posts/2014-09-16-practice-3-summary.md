description: Summary of our third weekly practice.
---

In the last practice, we had a free practice session where we discussed the problems
from our first tryouts. We had originally planned to cover search algorithms, but 
due to our busy schedules, we were unable to prepare a lecture.

<br>

As a reminder, our second and final tryouts will be this Saturday, September 20th. If 
you intend to participate, please visit the Announcements page and make sure you 
follow the instructions provided in the tryouts announcements to register for the
tryouts.

<br>

In our next practice, we will announce the Regionals teams based on the tryouts 
results and discuss competition strategy. This will include how to triage a problem 
set at the beginning of a competition, how to distribute problems among team members, 
how to work as a team using only one computer, and how to practice in preparation 
for our Regionals competition.

<br>

To help us cover these topics, we will have a guest speaker, Jingbo Shang, who has 
come in <b><i>2nd place</b></i> at World Finals in the past! Even if you will not be 
attending Regionals, this meeting will be a great chance to pick the brain of a 
veteran. Additionally, these skills will help you in other ICPC-style competitions, 
so we encourage you to attend.

<br>

Happy coding, and good luck at this weekend's tryouts!
