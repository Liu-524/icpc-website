We are looking for new officers for SIG-ICPC! Our current ACM liaison/vice 
chair, Yong Hong, is graduating this semester, and we need someone to take his place 
in the spring. We are also looking for students who are interested in taking the 
positions of team captain, which involves leading some of the practices and 
encouraging students to participate actively, and treasurer, which involves managing 
the finances of the SIG. If you are interested in any of the positions and are 
willing to dedicate the time required to do a good job, please e-mail Uttam (netid:
thakore1) immediately!
