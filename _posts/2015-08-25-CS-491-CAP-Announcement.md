In a break from last year's format, we have 
created a seminar course, CS 491 CAP, for the lecture portion of ICPC. The 
course will be held every Wednesday from 2-3 PM in Siebel 1131. In the 
seminar, we will go over algorithms and data structures topics that will 
appear during the Regionals and World Finals competitions and 
assign problem sets for you to use to practice those concepts. <strike>The course is mandatory for anyone interested in competing in the ICPC regionals this year.</strike> <b>UPDATE:</b> Completion of 
course passing requirements, which are detailed in the [course syllabus][3],
is mandatory for anyone interested in competing in the ICPC regionals this 
year. You do not, however, need to sign up for or attend the course, though 
it is highly encouraged.
For more information, please visit the [course website][2].

<br>

Our normal practices will be held weekly on Tuesdays from 6-8 PM. During the 
practices, we will go over practice problems assigned at the previous week's 
CS 491 CAP seminar and answer any questions you have. The practices should be 
used as an opportunity to learn hands-on techniques for quickly and correctly 
solving ICPC problems. We will also use the practices to announce important 
information about ICPC, including tryouts dates and results and Regionals 
logistics.

semester, please refer to the [calendar][1] page.
