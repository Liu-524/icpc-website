Hi all, our practices time will be held weekly on Tuesdays from 6-8 PM. There
will be lecture-style walkthroughs of some problems. Also, if that time doesn't
work for you, email `hong115@illinois.edu` and we my add a new time.


By the way, check out the calendar page for a more up-to-date schedule.
