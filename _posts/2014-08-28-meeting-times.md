Hi all, our practices will be held weekly on Tuesdays from 6-8 PM. We
will hold lecture-style walkthroughs of various algorithm and data structures
topics that will appear during the Regionals and World Finals competitions and
go over problems for each topic.

<br>

We have heard that some of you may not be able to make the meeting time
given above. We will be sending out a poll soon to determine if we
need to change the meeting time.

<br>
For an up-to-date schedule and information on other events throughout the semester, please refer to the calendar page.
