description: Get ready for another season of ICPC!
---

Welcome back from winter break! We hope everyone is well-rested and ready for 
ICPC!

<br>

Our first meeting of the semester will be on Tuesday, January 26th from 
6-8 PM in 0218 Siebel Center. Our first meeting will be a welcome meeting, 
so we will be explaining how ICPC works and answering any questions about ICPC 
that you may have. Bring anyone you know who might be interested 
in ICPC!

<br>
This semester, our practices will be designed to teach you how to solve 
algorithmic programming problems of different varieties at different difficulty 
levels. Unlike the fall semester,the practices will be much more 
hands-on and geared to everyone's individual skill levels. If you were deterred from 
our practices last semester due to the pace, you should find our practices this 
semester more approachable and valuable.
<br>
<br>
We hope to see everyone at the kickoff ICPC meeting!
