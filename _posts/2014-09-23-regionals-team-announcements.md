As was mentioned at the last practice, due to limited space at our Regionals site, 
we can only guarantee that the first three teams will be able to attend Regionals. 
We will know by October 18th how many more of the teams will be able to attend, but 
until then, all of the students mentioned above should be practicing with their team 
with the expectation that they will be attending Regionals.
