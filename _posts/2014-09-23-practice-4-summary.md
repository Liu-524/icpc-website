In the last practice, we announced the teams for Regionals and went over the problems 
from the tryouts. We also discussed various elements of competition strategy, which 
included the importance of triaging a problem set, how to triage, how to distribute 
problems among team members, and how to work as a team using only one computer.

<br>

Triaging involves reading through a problem set and identifying the difficulties and 
types of algorithms required for each problem. In individual competitions, triaging 
should be done before coding any problems, as it is possible that the first easy 
problem you see is not the easiest and fastest problem to code. For team competitions, 
while one person is coding the easiest problem, the others should be triaging the 
remaining set before attempting to solve any problems.

<br>

At the practice, we practiced triaging using the 2012 Mid-Central ICPC Regionals 
problem set. We encourage everyone who did not attend the practice to attempt to 
triage the problem set, which is located [here](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2012/mcpc2012/browse.html). 
We also encourage everyone to practice triaging with last year's Regionals problem 
set, which is located [here](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2013/mcpc2013/browse.html). 
After you have come up with a ranking of difficulties and types of problems, you can 
evaluate your answers using the "general notes on the problem set" and the "judge's 
notes" available on the contest materials page.

<br>

Additionally, we went over the reference materials teams are allowed to bring to 
Regionals and gave some recommendations on what to include in your team's set. Visit 
the Mid-Central region's [rules page](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/rules.html#ref) for 
the full information on what reference materials you can take with you. We require 
that each team spend the time preparing their own reference materials before the 
competition, as this can be the difference between solving 4 problems and solving 6.

<br>

At next week's practice, we will go over simulation problems, which make up a 
considerable portion of our Regionals problem set. If you are on a Regionals team, 
we highly recommend that you attend this practice. Of course, the practice is open 
to anyone who is interested in learning.
