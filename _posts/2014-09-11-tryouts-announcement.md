Tryouts for the ACM ICPC Regionals competition will be held from on Sunday, 
September 14th from 12-5 PM, and on Saturday, September 20th from 12-5 PM. Both 
tryouts will be held in room 520 of the Digital Computer Laboratory (DCL), 
which is an EWS Linux lab. We will be providing lunch for competitors only at 
11:30 AM, and there will be snacks and water for consumption during the 
competition. Please make sure you arrive before 12 PM to get situated for the 
competition, as we will begin promptly at 12 PM.

*If you would like to represent UIUC at the Mid-Central Regionals competition 
with a chance to advance to the World Finals competition, you <b>must</b>
participate in one of the two tryouts!*

<br>

We *strongly* encourage anyone interested in being part of the Regionals teams 
to compete in as many of the tryouts as you can. Each tryout will have a 
unique problem set, so your performance on one set may be different than your 
performance on the other. If you compete in both tryouts, we will factor 
your performance in both into our decisions when deciding teams. Even if you 
are not planning on competing at Regionals this year, we encourage you to 
participate in the tryouts to get a feel for ICPC-style competitions.

<br>

In order to make sure that you have a login for the tryouts contest 
environment, please fill out the poll available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qi1LQvW7qnh3lHmWqdO4xU-P1M0Zd5_iWEUWv589FUg/viewform?usp=send_form).
Registration here will also be important to ensure that your participation is 
properly factored into the team deciding process for Regionals.

<br>

Except for API documentation (such as cplusplus.com or the Java API), no 
outside materials will be allowed during the tryouts competition. Please
practice ahead of time and familiarize yourself with the implementation of 
various common algorithms.

If you have any questions regarding tryouts, please e-mail Uttam
(netid: thakore1). Good luck with your preparation, and we'll see you at the 
tryouts!
