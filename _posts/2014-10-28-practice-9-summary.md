At today's practice, we went over contest strategy again, discussing some topics that 
we were not able to cover at our previous contest strategy meeting. Specifically, we 
went through how to read input from files (if it happens to be necessary) in all 
three languages allowed in ICPC competitions (C, C++, and Java), revisited the 
importance of triaging, talked about how to divide up problems between 
teammates and make effective use of the computer, and introduced the concept of 
analyzing the bounds on the problem to determine what algorithm complexities are 
feasible.

As Regionals are upon us (this Saturday!), we also went over the contest environment 
that will be available at Regionals and made sure all Regionals teams were prepared 
with their reference material packets.

<br>

Next week will be our final meeting of the semester! We will have some fun, discuss 
problems from the Regionals competition, and talk about how you can practice on your 
own in the time that we are not meeting. We are also looking for people interested in 
becoming part of the leadership of SIG-ICPC in the coming year, and more urgently, 
for a chair for the SIG starting January who will be our liason to the ACM office. If 
you are interested, please let Uttam know via e-mail (netid: thakore1) and come to 
next week's meeting.
