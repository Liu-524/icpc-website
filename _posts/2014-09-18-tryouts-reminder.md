Our final tryouts for the ACM ICPC Regionals competition will be held this Saturday, 
September 20th from 12-5 PM. As was the case with the first tryout, this tryout will 
be held in room 520 of the Digital Computer Laboratory (DCL), which is an EWS Linux 
lab. We will be providing lunch for competitors at 11:30 AM, and there will be 
snacks and water for consumption during the competition. Please make sure you arrive 
before 12 PM to get situated for the competition, as we will begin promptly at 12 PM. 
If you are not familiar with EWS Linux labs or would like to know which IDEs will be 
available during the competition, please visit the lab room before Saturday.

*If you would like to represent UIUC at the Mid-Central Regionals competition 
with a chance to advance to the World Finals competition, you <b>must</b>
participate in one of the two tryouts!*

<br>

If you did not perform as well in the first tryout as you had hoped, this tryout will 
be your chance to improve your performance and secure a spot on a top team. The
problem set for this tryout will be unique, so your performance on this set may be 
different than your performance on the first. If you compete in both tryouts, we will 
factor your performance in both into our decisions when deciding teams. Even if you 
are not planning on competing at Regionals this year, we encourage you to 
participate in the tryouts to get a feel for ICPC-style competitions.

<br>

As a reminder, you must fill out the poll available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qi1LQvW7qnh3lHmWqdO4xU-P1M0Zd5_iWEUWv589FUg/viewform?usp=send_form) 
before Friday morning. Only those who are registered by that time will be given a 
username and allowed to compete.

<br>

Except for API documentation (such as cplusplus.com or the Java API), no 
outside materials will be allowed during the tryouts competition. Please
practice ahead of time and familiarize yourself with the implementation of 
various common algorithms.
