description: Here are the practice problems for next week's practice!
---

Next week (May 5th), Mike Seo will be holding this semester's final practice on 
number theory and combinatorics. He will be referring to the following 
problemset:

<br/>

Number Theory

  * [Big Mod][1]
  * [Street Trees][2]
  * [Humble Numbers][3]
  * [Help Mr. Tomisu][4]

Combinatorics

  * [Combination][5]
  * [Halloween Treats][6]
  * [Mixing Invitations][7]
  * [Cheerleaders][8]
  * [How Many?][9]


<br/>

As always, attempt these problems before next week's practice. 
The problems are roughly in increasing order of difficulty.

<br/>

For your reference, number theory and combinatorics are covered in section 5.3
and 5.5 of the Competitive Programming book by Steven Halim, available [here][Halim]. 
Learning about pigeon hole principle and inclusion-exclusion principle will especially 
be helpful for solving some of the combinatorics problems listed above. Consult the Stanford 
University's competitive programming course lecture [slides][Stanford] for basic math concepts. 
However, the slides are not exhasutive (i.e. the math concepts I have listed are not covered in 
these slides). Wikipedia seems to have pretty good explanations, so please try to study these 
concepts by yourself. Also, as combinatorics and dynamic programming are closely related, do not 
be surprised to use DP techniques to solve some of these problems.

 
<br/>

As always, priority will be given at the practice to helping 
students through any issues they have experienced while attempting to solve 
the problems, so do not come to practice expecting to be taught all of the 
concepts. Mike will spend some time going over the concepts at the practice 
and will answer questions. Use the resources provided above 
and <i>try to solve the problems yourself</i> before attending, as you will 
gain the most from the practice by doing so!


<br/>

Happy coding!
