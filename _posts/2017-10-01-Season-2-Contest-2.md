# **Find Remainder**
For each pair of \\(A, B\\), we are asked to output the remainder for A divided by B. This is accomplished by operator \\(%\\) in most programming languages. 

**Complexity:** O(1)

**Sample Solution:** [A-remain.cpp]

# **Puppy and Sum**
Observe that we can write the recursive definition of \\(sum\\): 

\\(sum(D, N) = sum(1, sum(D-1, N))\\)  for \\(D > 1\\)

\\(sum(1, N) = sum(N) = \frac{N * (N+1)}{2}\\) 

**Complexity:** O(\\(D\\))

**Sample Solution:** [B-ppsum.cpp]

# **AtCoDeer and Election Report**

**Sample Solution:** [filename3]

# **Marathon**

**Sample Solution:** [filename4]

# **Restore Graph**

**Sample Solution:** [filename5]

# **Lego Blocks**

**Sample Solution:** [filename6]

# **Nice SubSegments**

**Sample Solution:** [filename7]
