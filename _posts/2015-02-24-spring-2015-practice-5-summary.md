description: UPDATED! Summary of our fifth weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

At today's practice, we discussed BFS and DFS, focusing on 4 of the problems from the 
[practice set](/announcements/2015/02/17/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-feb-17.html), 
which we went through in detail, including complete code.  We discussed various 
approaches to BFS/DFS and their advantages and disadvantages.  We also answered 
specific student questions and discussed some contest strategies.

<strike>
Next week, Uttam will be going over built-in data structures in Java and C++11 and 
the language constructs and libraries you should know for programming competitions. 
Problems will be posted by the end of the week. Until then, continue to work on any 
of the problems you have not yet finished from the last 2 content practices.

<b>UPDATE</b> (Feb 26 at 10 PM): 

Due to time constraints, Uttam will not be holding the built-in data structures 
practice next week.
Instead, we will be having a collaborative problem solving session in which you can 
work on the problems from the last 2 sessions together with other students in the 
SIG. If you haven't yet finished solving all of the problems, this is a great way 
to get help from others and share ideas on how to implement these kinds of problems 
more efficiently. For your reference, the problemsets are available [here][1] and 
[here][2].

Happy coding!
