description: Summary of our seventh weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

At today's practice, we discussed intermediate graph algorithms, focusing on the problems from the 
[practice set](/announcements/2015/03/10/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-mar-10.html).  
We discussed solutions to all of the problems in the problem set and also briefly went over 
various graph algorithms including Kruskal's algorithm. 
We also answered specific questions some students had. 

<br/>

Next week is going to be a Spring break, so there will be no practice. However, we want to
remind you that the NAIPC will be held during the Spring break. Anyone who wants an additional
practice is encouraged to participate in it.

<br/>

Happy coding!
