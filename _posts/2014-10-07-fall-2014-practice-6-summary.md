description: Summary of our sixth weekly practice of the Fall 2014 semester.
---

Todayâ€™s practice was less well-attended, so we spent a lot of time covering 
basic graph concepts, such as the definition of a graph, how to represent it 
in your code, interesting properties of graphs, and types of graphs. We 
covered the basic graph (and grid) searching algorithms breadth-first search 
(BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), and went over problem I from the second 
tryout (available [here](http://domjudge.cs.illinois.edu/public/problem.php?id=tryTwoI)), 
which requires the use of BFS.

At the next practice, we will be going over geometry problems, which always 
appear at our regionals. We will go over basic geometry concepts as well as 
techniques to solve computational geometry problems like the ones you might 
see at regionals. As always, pizza will be provided.
