description: Here are the practice problems for next week's practice!
---

This week (April 7th), Jingbo Shang will be holding a practice on 
advanced graph problems. Specifically, he will be covering advanced connected 
components, flow, and matching problems. He will be referring to the following 
problemset:

<br/>

Strong Connected Component (SCC):

  * [Popular Cows][1]

Biconnected Component (edges):

  * [Redundant Paths][2]

Max Flow: 

  * [Drainage Ditches][3]

Minimum Bipartite Matching: 

  * [Ants][4]


<br/>

Try to attempt these problems before the practice. Since there is limited time 
between today and the practice, Jingbo will spend some time going over the concepts 
at the practice and will answer questions, but priority will still be given to 
those with specific questions about their solutions.

<br/>

While these problems may not necessarily come up at the Mid-Central Regionals, being 
able to solve these types of problems is essential to performing well at World Finals 
and many other programming competitions, so do put in the effort.

<br/>

For your reference, many of the algorithms required to solve these problems are 
explained in chapter 4 of the Competitive Programming book by Steven Halim, available 
[here][Halim]. 
TopCoder also has a wide array of advanced graph problem tutorials, including an 
incredibly vast selection of tutorials on network flow algorithms. They are 
available here:

Max flow:

  * [Max Flow - Part 1][5]
  * [Max Flow - Part 2][6]
  * [Comparison of Augmenting Path Algos][7]
  * [Push-Relabel Approach to Max Flow][8]

Min-Cost Flow:

  * [Min-Cost Flow - Part 1][9]
  * [Min-Cost Flow - Part 2][10]
  * [Min-Cost Flow - Part 3][11]

Bipartite Matching:

  * [Assignment Problem and the Hungarian Algorithm][12]

<br/>

<b>Note:</b> These tutorials are a little advanced, so you may find more value by 
first looking at the Competitive Programming book and referring to the tutorials only 
if you understand the concepts fairly well.

<br/>

Happy coding!
