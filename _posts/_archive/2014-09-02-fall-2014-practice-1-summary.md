description: Summary of our first weekly practice of the Fall 2014 semester.
---

In today's practice, we covered some problems that do not require any
specifically complex algorithms. All the problems we covered can be solved
using basic algorithms such as sorting and binary search.

Here is the list of problems from the last practice:

We didnâ€™t get a chance to cover the third problem, but we suggest everyone 
to try to solve the third problem on their own. It is definitely more 
difficult than the first two, but it is possible to solve it using only the 
basic algorithms we covered in the meeting.

Don't forget to send Mike (netid: jmseo2) your SPOJ username if you haven't already! We will
be using SPOJ to host practice problems.

<br>

In the next meeting, we will be covering basic math skills such as basic 
combinatorics and probability. As always, pizza will be served.
