description: Summary of our seventh weekly practice of the Fall 2014 semester.
---

At today's practice, we discussed basic geometry concepts and their relation 
to ICPC-style problems.  In particular, we covered basics of lines, circles, 
and their intersections.  We also discussed basic vector concepts and 
operations, and their applications to ICPC-style problems.

<br>

In addition, we went over computational geometry problems that have appeared 
at regionals in previous years. The problems we discussed included:

<br>

Medium difficulty (solution should not be too difficult):

  * [Crash and Go(relians)](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2011/mcpc2011/crash/crash.html)
  * [Cell Towers](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2009/mcpc2009/cell/cell.html)

<br>

Hard (also good practice but will require significantly more effort):

  * [Line &amp; Circle Maze](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2008/mcpc2008/maze/maze.html)
  * [Laser Tag](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2011/mcpc2011/laser/laser.html)

For additional reference, you can find a deck of slides that describes the 
concepts and algorithms at [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ill6u28dfguzqn9/Lecture%207%20-%20Computational%20Geometry.pdf?dl=0). 
We did not use this slide deck during today's practice, but it was used last year to 
cover the same geometry concepts.

At next week's practice, we will go over dynamic programming (DP) in its 
various forms and show how it can be used to solve certain types of problems. 
Please attend, as using DP in competitions can be a tricky topic for many 
people! As always, pizza will be provided.
