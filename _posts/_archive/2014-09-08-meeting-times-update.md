Of the 22 responses we received to the meeting times poll, only one student 
was unable to attend a practice on Tuesdays. As a result, we will be continuing 
to hold our weekly practices on Tuesdays from 6-8 PM in 0218 Siebel Center. If 
you are one of the few students for whom Tuesdays do not work, please continue 
to check this website every week for a practice summary and the set of 
problems we solved during the practice, and try your hand at them outside of 
practice. If you have any questions or need more guidance, let us know through 
the mailing list or by contacting me directly (netid: thakore1).

As a reminder, our next practice will be tomorrow, Tuesday, September 8th. 
Mike will be going over math-based problems, with topics including 
combinatorics and number theory. As always, pizza will be provided. We look 
forward to seeing you there!
