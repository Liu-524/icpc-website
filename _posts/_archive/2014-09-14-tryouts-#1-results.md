Congratulations to Mike Seo for winning the first tryout competition by solving 
7 of the 9 problems. Also congratulations to Ruihan Shan and Hao Gao for 
placing second and third, respectively, by solving 4 problems. Everyone did a 
wonderful job, and only one problem remained unsolved at the end of the 
competition.

<br>

The final scoreboard is available at [http://domjudge.cs.illinois.edu/public/](http://domjudge.cs.illinois.edu/public/) 
and will remain up until the end of day Friday. I have also opened the contest 
to submissions until end of day Friday for those of you who would like to try 
their hand at the problems or solve the problems you weren’t able to get 
during the tryout. The contest environment can be accessed at 
[http://domjudge.cs.illinois.edu/team/](http://domjudge.cs.illinois.edu/team/) 
using the username and password you received in your e-mail. If you did not 
register for the tryout but would like to try your hand at the problems, 
please e-mail Uttam (netid: thakore1).

Our second and final tryout will be next Saturday, September 20th from 12-5 PM. 
If you did not perform as well as you had hoped or were not able to make this 
tryout, you still have another chance at making it onto a regionals team! **If 
you would like to participate in next week’s tryout, make sure to fill out the 
Google docs poll [available here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qi1LQvW7qnh3lHmWqdO4xU-P1M0Zd5_iWEUWv589FUg/viewform?usp=send_form)!!!**

As a reminder, there will be a meeting this Tuesday on search problems. We look 
forward to seeing you all there!
