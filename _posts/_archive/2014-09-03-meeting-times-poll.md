description: Update regarding rescheduling our weekly practices.
---

A few of you have mentioned that Tuesdays from 6-8 PM are not as convenient
for you, or that you had a conflict with another SIG meeting at that time.
We have created a poll that we will use to decide when to hold our weekly
practices. Please note that the available times reflect the days when we are
available to hold practices, so we will not be able to accommodate arbitrary
dates or times. We will accept responses until Sunday night, after which point
we will send out an announcement on the final practice time.

Please fill out the poll **even if you are fine with the current meeting time**.
Otherwise, the meeting time could change due to the submissions of people who
currently have conflicts.
