description: Here are the practice problems for next week's practice!
---

Next week (March 17th), Mike Seo will be holding a practice on 
intermediate graph problems. He will be referring to the following 
problemset:

<br/>

Minimum/Maximum Spanning Trees:

  * [Freckles][1]
  * [Heavy Cargo][2]
  * [Re-connecting Computer Sites][3]

Shortest path:

  * [Sending Email][4]
  * [Fire Station][5]
  * [Full Tank][6]

Strongly Connected Components:

  * [Trust groups][7]
  * [Dominos][8]
  * [Lighting Away][9]

<br/>

As always, attempt these problems before next week's practice. The problems 
within each category are listed somewhat in increasing order of difficulty, 
so start with the first problems and work your way down the lists. For mid-
central regional, it is essential for you to at least know how to solve MST and
shortest path problems. For your reference, MST and shortest path are covered 
in chapter 4 of the Competitive Programming book by Steven Halim, available 
[here][Halim]. Also check out a great [slide deck][StanfordGraph] on the Stanford University
competitive programming course covering various basic graph algorithms including SCC. 
For sample codes, search on Google and find ones that are easy to understand for you.

<br/>

One important note: priority will be given at the practice to helping 
students through any issues they have experienced while attempting to solve 
the problems, so do not come to practice expecting a full lecture on 
computational geometry concepts. Use the resources provided above and <i>try 
to solve the problems yourself</i> before attending, as you will gain the 
most from the practice by doing so!

<br/>

Happy coding!
