description: Summary of our first weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

In today's practice, we welcomed some new students and practiced some 
problems from previous regionals competitions. Here is the list of 
problems from the practice:

 * [Word Cloud, Problem E from 2014's regional](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2014/mcpc2014/cloud/cloud.html)
 * [Sokoban, Problem G from 2011's regional](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2011/mcpc2011/sokoban/sokoban.html)

<br>

If you weren't able to finish solving the problems at the practice, we 
encourage you to attempt to get the problem correct on your own before 
looking at the judges' solutions. If you are getting stuck on a test case, 
try working out the example on paper to see if you can find the bug in 
your code.

<br>

Once you feel that you have solved the problem, try running your code on 
the judge data available [here](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2014/mcpc2014/cloud/io.html)
for Word Cloud and [here](http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2011/mcpc2011/sokoban/io.html)
for Sokoban. Try first to debug your code without looking at the specific 
test cases on which you failed. If you get stuck, feel free to e-mail 
[the mailing list](mailto:icpc-l@acm.uiuc.edu) or Uttam (netid: [thakore1](mailto:thakore1@illinois.edu)).
Try to solve both problems if you can!

<br>

At the end of the meeting, we also took a poll on the topics you are 
interested in learning about this semester. We will be releasing the 
practice schedule soon. Keep posted on the website for details!

<br>

Next Tuesday, we will be having a special repeat of this meeting for 
those who just learned of ICPC through the ACM open house. We will be 
covering the same information. If you attended this week's meeting, 
you don't need to attend next week's. Regular meetings will resume 
the following week.

<br>

Happy coding!
