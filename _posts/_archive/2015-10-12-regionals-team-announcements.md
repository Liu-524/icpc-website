If you are listed above as being on a team, please make sure to attend 
tomorrow's Tuesday practice, as we will be choosing team names and registering 
you for the regionals competition. If you cannot make the practice for any 
reason, please let me know as soon as possible so I can make sure you 
complete the registration before tomorrow.

<br>

As we mentioned at the tryouts, due to limited space at our Regionals site, 
we can only guarantee that the first four teams will be able to attend 
Regionals. We will know by October 26th how many more of the teams will be 
able to attend, but until then, all of the students mentioned above should be 
practicing with their team with the expectation that they will be attending 
Regionals.

<br>

If you did not make it on a team, don't feel discouraged -- the competition 
was fierce this year, and we spent quite a bit of time trying to decide who to 
take to Regionals. We encourage you to continue practicing and try out again 
next year. Some of the people who made it onto teams this year were in the 
same situation as you last year.
