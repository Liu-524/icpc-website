Welcome back from winter break! We will be starting back up for the spring semester 
next week on Tuesday, January 27th from 6-8 PM in 0218 Siebel center (in the 
basement).

<br/>

Our practices this semester will be held on Tuesdays from 6-8 PM, but there 
will be some deviations from this schedule from time to time. Keep checking our 
calendar throughout the semester for all up-to-date official practice and meeting 
information.

<br/>

This semester, our practices will be designed to teach you how to solve 
algorithmic programming problems of different varieties at different difficulty 
levels. Unlike the fall semester, we will not be training for a specific contest, so 
the practices will be much more 
hands-on and geared to everyone's individual skill levels. If you were deterred from 
our practices last semester due to the pace, you should find our practices this 
semester more approachable and valuable.

<br>

We look forward to seeing everyone at our meeting next Tuesday! Don't forget to 
invite your friends!
