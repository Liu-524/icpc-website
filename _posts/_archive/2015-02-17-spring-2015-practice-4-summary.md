description: Summary of our fourth weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

In today's practice, 
we went over the TopCoder Arena and competing in a TopCoder SRM. We discussed how to 
launch the arena and enter contests, how to use the practice rooms to practice old 
TopCoder contest problems, and how single round matches (SRMs) are structured. We 
then competed in SRM 650 together. At the end of the SRM, all new members received 
TopCoder ratings! Congratulations to everyone who participated in the SRM for a great 
performance!

<br/>

We encourage everyone to register for TopCoder and use the practice rooms to practice, 
even if you weren't able to make today's meeting. We also encourage you to participate 
in upcoming SRMs on your own. All upcoming SRMs through the end of March have been 
added to our [calendar](/calendar.html), so check it out and plan ahead.

Next week, Timothy Smith will be covering graph search (breadth-first search and 
depth-first search) problems. The
problemset is available in the Announcements section of the website, in [this](/announcements/2015/02/17/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-feb-17.html)
post. Please attempt as many of these problems as you can on your own before coming
to practice, as we will not be going over all of the problems there. Instead, at the
practice, Timothy will give a short overview of graph search problems, go over a 
problem or two,
and answer any questions you may have. You can also use the practice time to discuss
solutions with other SIG-ICPC members.

<br/>

We look forward to seeing everyone at next week's meeting. Until then, <i>happy
coding</i>!
