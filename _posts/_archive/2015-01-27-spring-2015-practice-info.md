description: Updates on the Spring 2015 practice schedule.
---

As mentioned at last Tuesday's meeting, this semester, our practices will be 
more hands-on. We plan to release problemsets the week before a practice, 
which you can work on individually or collaboratively. At the following 
practice, we will go over the topic, potentially working through an example 
problem. We will then open the practice to questions and discussion, at which 
point you can continue working on the problems or get help from one of the 
practice leaders.

We will release the schedule for this semester's practices sometime within the 
next week or two. Keep posted here for updates!
