description: Summary of our second weekly practice of the Fall 2014 semester.
---

In the last practice, we covered some basic number theory concepts and related 
problems. Everyone should know what GCD and LCM are, and know how to compute 
them quickly using the Euclidean algorithm. 

Everyone should know the formula gcd(a, b)lcm[a,b] = ab. 

We also covered how to find a list of primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes 
and went over some basic properties of the Euler phi (totient) function. 

<br>

We then solved some easy problems using concepts of GCD and LCM.

Aim to be able to solve problems of this level of difficulty less than 10 
minutes.

<br>

Also, try to solve practice problems in the math section uploaded on our SPOJ 
practice website ([available here](http://www.spoj.com/UIUC/problems/math)).
(If you cannot submit a problem on our SPOJ practice website, please send your
SPOJ username to Mike (netid: jmseo2).)

In the next meeting, we will cover some basic search algorithms such as depth 
first search and breadth first search. Many problems in our regional involve 
using these two algorithms, so donâ€™t miss it! As always, free pizza will be 
provided.
