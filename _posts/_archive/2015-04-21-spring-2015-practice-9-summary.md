description: Summary of our ninth weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

At today's practice, Jingbo gave a lecture on advanced graph problems using the 
slide deck available [here][1]. Specifically, he went over the following types of 
graph problems:

  * Maximum (weighted) bipartite matching
  * Max flow
  * Min cost max flow

<br/>

He introduced some basic algorithms that can be used to solve these problems and 
provided sample problems on online judges for practice.

<br/>

Additionally, Jingbo went over two set dynamic programming problems as well. He 
discussed two different implementation strategies, i.e. row-wise and entry-wise, and 
went over the corresponding problems that were provided in the problem set.

<br/>

Next week, there will be no practice. We have the room reserved, so you are free to 
meet in 0218 SC to work on the practice problems together. Mike Seo will be leading 
the following and final practice of the semester on May 5th, covering combinatorics 
and number theory. This is an extremely important topic for ICPC competitions, so be 
sure to attend! We will also be performing the semester wrap-up and taking your 
feedback on how we conducted practices this semester. If you have comments, good 
or bad, come to the practice and voice your opinions.

<br/>

Happy coding!
