description: Summary of our eighth weekly practice of the Fall 2014 semester.
---

At today's practice, Jingbo gave a guest lecture on basic dynamic programming (DP) 
problems using the slide deck available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/92ziliavshtn28s/Lecture%208%20-%20Dynamic%20Programming.pdf?dl=0). 
Specifically, we went over the following major types of DP problems:

  * linear DP (e.g., the knapsack problem and its variations; example 1 in the slides)
  * interval-based DP (example 3 in the slides)
  * DP over trees (e.g., the minimum dominating set problem on a tree; example 4 in 
the slides)
  * DP over sets (examples 5 and 6 in the slides), and some tricks to efficiently 
enumerate all possible subsets

<br>

In addition to the DP problems, we examined a problem that looked quite similar to 
an example DP problem, but actually required the shortest path algorithm instead 
(example 2 in the slides).

<br>

We have provided practice problems for you to try for most of the types of DP 
problems. Please look at the [slide deck](https://www.dropbox.com/s/92ziliavshtn28s/Lecture%208%20-%20Dynamic%20Programming.pdf?dl=0) 
for details.

Next week will be our last practice before Regionals. We will be rehashing contest 
strategy and providing additional tricks for doing well at the competition. If time 
allows, we will also cover some fundamental graph algorithms, including shortest 
path and minimum spanning tree. If you are on a regionals team, please make sure 
to attend!
