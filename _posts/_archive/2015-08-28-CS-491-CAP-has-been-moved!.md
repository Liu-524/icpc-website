Based on the results of the poll, we have decided to move the CS 491 CAP lecture to Fridays from 2-3 PM in DCL 1310. We have also increased the course capacity to 75. We are aware that this time does not work for everyone, and we apologize if moving the course has made it infeasible for you to attend. However, this is the time that works for the most students that we are also able to teach the course.

If you are not able to attend the lecture, you can still follow along with the material and assignments on the course website. We will not be able to record the lectures, but we will be posting our lecture slides and links to additional self-practice resources on the course website. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to ask them during our regular SIG-ICPC practices on Tuesdays from 6-8 PM in Siebel 0218.

For those interested in competing in the Mid-Central Regionals, completion of the weekly problem sets will be sufficient to qualify for participation in Regionals. Attendance or registration in the course is no longer mandatory.
