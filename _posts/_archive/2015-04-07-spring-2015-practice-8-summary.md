description: Summary of our eighth weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

There was very low attendance at today's practice, so we have combined this week's 
topic with next week's. Next week, Jingbo will be covering advanced graph problems 
and advanced dynamic programming (DP) problems. Make sure to check out and attempt 
[this week's problemset](/announcements/2015/04/06/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-mar-31.html) 
and [next week's problemset](/announcements/2015/04/09/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-apr-07.html)
before the practice, as with advanced topics like these, you will not gain much from 
the practice without spending some time with the problems and concepts first. The 
problemset pages have a large list of tutorials you can use to learn about the 
concepts.

Happy coding!
