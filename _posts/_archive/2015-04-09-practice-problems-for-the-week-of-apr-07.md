description: Here are the practice problems for next week's practice!
---

Next week (April 14th), Jingbo Shang will be holding a practice on 
advanced dynamic programming problems. He will be referring to the following 
problemset:

<br/>

Tree DP:

  * [Rebuilding Roads][1]

Monotone Queue DP:

  * [Bad Hair Day][2]
  * [Dividing the Path][3]

Set DP: 

  * [Hardwood Floor][4]
  * [Another Chocolate Maniac][5]

Connection DP: 

  * [Formula 1][6]

<br/>

As always, attempt these problems before next week's practice. 
While these problems may not necessarily come up at the Mid-Central Regionals, being 
able to solve these types of problems is essential to performing well at World Finals 
and many other programming competitions, so do put in the effort.

<br/>

For your reference, dynamic programming is covered in section 3.4 of the 
Competitive Programming book by Steven Halim, available [here][Halim]. DP is 
not a specific algorithm, but rather a technique for solving a class of 
problems, so simply reading the book or looking at tutorials will not help you 
as much as actually solving problems. If you are still stumped about DP, go 
back to [our earlier practice on simple DP algorithms](/announcements/2015/02/04/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-feb-03.html) 
and make sure you can solve all of the problems there.
TopCoder also has a tutorial on dynamic programming, available [here][TopCoderDP].
 
<br/>

As always, priority will be given at the practice to helping 
students through any issues they have experienced while attempting to solve 
the problems, so do not come to practice expecting to be taught all of the 
concepts. Jingbo will spend some time going over the concepts at the practice 
and will answer questions, but with the difficulty levels of these problems, 
it will not be possible to cover everything! Use the resources provided above 
and <i>try to solve the problems yourself</i> before attending, as you will 
gain the most from the practice by doing so!


<br/>

Happy coding!
