description: Summary of our first weekly practice of the Fall 2015 semester.
---

In today's practice, we went over the basics of ICPC and the dates of this 
year's tryouts competition. This year, tryouts will be held on September 
12th and September 19th. The times and rooms will be announced as they are 
finalized. We also went over eligibility to compete in Regionals. Please 
look at the [eligibility flowchart][2] to see whether you will be able to 
compete. Even if you are ineligible, we still welcome you to both the practices 
and the seminar course.

<br>

As a reminder, the first CS 491 CAP lecture will be tomorrow from 2-3 PM in 
Siebel 1131. This seminar will cover the algorithms and data structures 
concepts necessary to do well in ICPC, and completion of the passing 
requirements for the course is mandatory for all students 
interested in competing in the Mid-Central Regionals. We hope to see all 
of you there.

In response to concern about the meeting time for the CS 491 CAP seminar 
overlapping with other courses, we will be sending out a poll by tomorrow 
asking for your availabilities throughout the week. We will try our best 
to find a time that works for as many people as possible, but we cannot 
guarantee that it will work for everyone. We will also not be able to record 
the lectures. The course materials will, however, be available for all students 
at the [course website][1], regardless of whether or not you register for the 
course. So long as you complete the required assignments in the course, you 
will be eligible to compete in Regionals.

Next week's meeting is targeted at new students who hear about ICPC through 
the ACM Open House. It will be largely the same as this meeting, so if you 
missed this week's meeting, make sure to attend next week's. If you know anyone 
who might be interested in ICPC, encourage them to attend next week's meeting.
