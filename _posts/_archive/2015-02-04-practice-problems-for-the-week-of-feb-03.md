Next week (February 10th), Mike Seo will be holding a practice on simple dynamic 
programming problems. He will be referring to the following problemset:

 * [Wavio Sequence](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=465&page=show_problem&problem=1475)
 * [The Tower of Babylon](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=465&page=show_problem&problem=378)

 * [Raucous Rockers](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=465&page=show_problem&problem=1195)
 * [Matrix Chain Multiplication](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=465&page=show_problem&problem=414)

<br/>

Attempt these problems before next week's practice. Going forward, as mentioned in 
[last week's announcement](/announcements/2015/01/27/spring-2015-practice-info.html) 
and [this week's practice summary](/practices/2015/02/03/spring-2015-practice-2-summary.html), 
we will be releasing problem sets like this one at the end of a practice for you to 
work on until the following practice.

<br/>

The problems above are listed roughly in increasing order of difficulty, so start 
with the first problem and work your way down the list if you are unfamiliar with 
dynamic programming problems. For your reference, there is a dynamic programming 
section in the Competitive Programming book by Steven Halim, available [here](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/myteaching/competitive_programming/cp1.pdf),
and a tutorial on DP on TopCoder, available [here](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=dynProg).

<br/>

Come to next week's practice with your code and questions for Mike. You will not gain 
as much coming empty-handed as you will if you at least attempt the problems before 
the practice!
