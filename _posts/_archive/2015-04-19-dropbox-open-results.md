Congratulations to the team of Yuting Zhang, Haozhen Ding, and Yewen Fan for winning 
the first ever Dropbox SIG-ICPC Open Programming Contest by solving 11 of the 15 
problems! Also, congratulations to Team UIUCBlack, consisting of Shivam Gupta, Ryan 
Jian, and Ruihan Shan, for taking second place by solving 10 problems, and the team 
of Olzhas Alipov, who singlehandedly took 3rd place by solving 9 problems! The final 
scoreboard is available at [http://domjudge.cs.illinois.edu/](http://domjudge.cs.illinois.edu/). 
All of the competitors 
on the top teams will be receiving Amazon gift cards as prizes for their amazing 
performance!

<br/>

We hope everyone enjoyed competing in the contest. If we missed you yesterday, there 
are plenty of additional opportunities to compete in other programming contests on 
our [calendar](/calendar.html). In particular, the TopCoder Open and Google Code Jam 
are both happening right now. If you haven’t already qualified for TopCoder Open, 
make sure to participate in one of the two remaining Rounds 1.

<br/>

If you enjoyed the competition and/or would like to find out more about what our 
SIG does, please [join our mailing list](https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/icpc-l) 
and check out the practice resources and our practice summaries.

<br/>

We are still holding weekly practices for the spring semester until the last week of 
classes. This coming Tuesday, April 21st, Jingbo Shang will be covering advanced DP 
and advanced graph problems. He will be using the two problemsets ([here](/announcements/2015/04/06/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-mar-31.html) 
and [here](/announcements/2015/04/09/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-apr-07.html)) 
that have been available on our website for the last two weeks. Make sure you try 
your hand at the problems before practice on Tuesday, as priority will be given to 
helping students with issues they have encountered while trying to solve the problems.

<br/>

We hope to see many of you at our practices either this semester or at the start of 
the Fall semester, when we will be gearing up for the 2015 ICPC Mid-Central 
Regionals competition. If you are interested in competing in next year’s World 
Finals competition, make sure to attend the first meetings of the Fall 2015 semester.

<br/>

Happy coding, and thanks for your interest in the Dropbox Open!
