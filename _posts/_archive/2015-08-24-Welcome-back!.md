description: Get ready for another season of ICPC!
---

Welcome back from summer break! We hope everyone is well-rested and ready for 
another season of ICPC!

<br>

Our first meeting of the semester will be tomorrow, Tuesday, August 25th from 
6-8 PM in 0218 Siebel Center. Our first meeting will be a welcome meeting, 
so we will be explaining how ICPC works and answering any questions about ICPC 
that you may have. We will also go over important upcoming dates, including 
tryouts and practice contests. Bring anyone you know who might be interested 
in ICPC!

<br>

This year, Dropbox has graciously sponsored our tryouts! They have also 
provided us with swag, which we will be handing out at tomorrow's meeting.

Lastly, this year, we have changed the format of the practices. We have 
created a 1-credit seminar course, CS 491 CAP, for the algorithms and data 
structures lecture portion of ICPC. The course is currently being added to 
the catalog, so we will send more information about it over the mailing list 
in the coming days. Since we will be going over algorithms topics during the 
course, it is mandatory for anyone interested in competing in the ICPC regionals 
this year.

We hope to see everyone at tomorrow's kickoff ICPC meeting!
