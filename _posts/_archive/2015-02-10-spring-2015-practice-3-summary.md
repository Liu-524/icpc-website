description: Summary of our third weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

In today's practice, we briefly went over what dynamic programming is and solved two 
simple dynamic programming problems: coin change and longest increasing subsequence. 
We solved two versions of coin change: minimization and counting. After that, we had 
a free practice session for another hour. The problems for the practice are available 
[here](/announcements/2015/02/04/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-feb-03.html); if 
you haven't already, try to solve as many of them as you can.

<br>

As we mentioned at the end of today's practice, next week, we will be having a 
special practice in which we guide you through a TopCoder single round match (SRM). 
TopCoder can be a great practice resource, so if you havenâ€™t already started using 
it, we encourage you to attend the practice to get familiarized with the contest 
arena and competition format. TopCoder is also rated, so you can see how well you 
fare in a competitive environment and try to boost your skills through regular 
participation in SRMs.

<br>

<b>Note:</b> The SRM we will be participating in starts at 8 PM and runs until 9:45, 
so we will be meeting at 7 PM instead of the usual 6. See our [calendar](/calendar.html) 
for the correct meeting information for the practice. We will spend the first hour 
going over the competition arena and doing a practice problem together, then start 
the SRM promptly at 8 PM. You must register to compete in the SRM, so make sure to 
arrive by 7:30 at the latest if you want to participate!

Happy coding!
