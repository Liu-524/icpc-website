description: Here are the practice problems for next week's practice!
---

Next week (March 10th), Timothy Smith will be holding a practice on simple 
computational geometry problems. He will be referring to the following 
problemset:

  * [Colourful Flowers][1]
  * [Soya Milk][2]
  * [The Grazing Cow][3]
  * [Elevator][4]
  * [Overlapping Rectangles][5]
  * [Sunny Mountains][6]
  * [Trash Removal][7]
  * [The Sultan's Problem][8]
  * [Bounding Box][9]

<br/>

As always, attempt these problems before next week's practice. The problems 
within each category are listed somewhat in increasing order of difficulty, 
so start with the first problems and work your way down the lists if you are 
unfamiliar with computational geometry problems. For your reference, 
computational geometry is covered in chapter 7 of the Competitive Programming 
book by Steven Halim, available [here][Halim], a series of wonderful geometry 
tutorials (parts [1][TopCoder1], [2][TopCoder2], and [3][TopCoder3]) on 
TopCoder, and a great [slide deck][CompGeomSlides] on the University of 
Alberta's programming team website (you'll need to ignore the snark).

<br/>

One important note: priority will be given at the practice to helping 
students through any issues they have experienced while attempting to solve 
the problems, so do not come to practice expecting a full lecture on 
computational geometry concepts. Use the resources provided above and <i>try 
to solve the problems yourself</i> before attending, as you will gain the 
most from the practice by doing so!

<br/>

Happy coding!
