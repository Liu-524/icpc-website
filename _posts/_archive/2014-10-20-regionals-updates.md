description: Exciting news about regionals teams!
---

We have some great news -- all five of our teams were accepted by the Mid-Central 
regional director, which means that all of our teams will be able to attend the 
regionals at the University of Chicago on November 1st! If you are on one of the 
regionals teams, you should already be practicing. Make sure you are ready and have
compiled your reference materials before the competition.

If you are on one of the teams, we will be sending out more information about the 
logistics of the regionals later this week. Good luck with your preparation!
