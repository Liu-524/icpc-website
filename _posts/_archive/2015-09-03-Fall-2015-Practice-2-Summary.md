<h1>Practice Summary</h1>
In this practice we covered the basics of ICPC to new members. If you missed the practice then check out these [slides][5]

New members who are at least proficient in either Java, C++, or C should register for the CS 491 CAP course (more information on that below).

If you are not proficient in one of those languages then we recommend you use the [USACO resources][7] to get started.
