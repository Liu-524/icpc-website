description: IMPORTANT!!! Information regarding registration for Saturday's practice contest.
---

As a reminder, there will be a practice contest this Saturday in DCL 520 from 2 â€“ 7 
PM. The contest is actually the [ACM-ICPC North America Qualification Contest](http://cs.ecs.baylor.edu/~hamerly/icpc/qualifier_2014/), 
which we are using this year for practice. All regionals teams should compete as 
teams, but anyone is welcome to request a login and participate individually or as a 
group for practice.

<br>

If you are interested in participating in the practice contest this Saturday, please 
register on the ICPC site (not our website), located at [https://icpc.baylor.edu](https://icpc.baylor.edu), 
and e-mail me (netid: thakore1) by Friday afternoon. Use your Illinois e-mail address 
for registration unless you have a strong reason to do otherwise. Please make sure 
your registration is complete before you e-mail me, as if I cannot find you in the 
ICPC system (either by your e-mail address or full name) when I get your e-mail, I 
will disregard it and you will not have a username for the competition on Saturday.

<br>

For those of you on Regionals teams, you will need to register on the ICPC site as 
well both for this contest and to be registered for Regionals. Please make sure you 
do this by this Saturday and let me know once you have. You are already registered 
for the practice contest and do not need to e-mail me to receive your login 
information. If you have any trouble, let me know as soon as possible.

<br>

Once I receive the login information for the contest, I will forward it to everyone 
who is registered. This should happen by Friday. I will not be present or available 
on Saturday to hand out additional usernames and passwords, so if you want to 
participate, you must e-mail me by Friday.

<br>

Thanks,

Uttam
