New practice materials have been added to the [Learn](/learn.html) page!
These include a problem classifier for SPOJ, more online judge sites, algorithm
tutorial sites, and a link to the best book to use to prepare for ICPC, 
Competitive Programming by Steven Halim.

<br>

If you want to be competitive at a World Finals level, we highly recommend that
you check out the [Competitive Programming](https://sites.google.com/site/stevenhalim/)
book and try to complete all of the Volume 1 problems at (http://acm.sgu.ru). You
should also practice increasing your coding speed by attempting to score over
240 points on TopCoder Division 1 250-point problems in the practice rooms
available through the TopCoder Arena.

<br>

In addition to practicing [the problems from our weekly practices](/practices.html),
you can try your hand at weekly competitions hosted by TopCoder and Codeforces.
Check out our [calendar](/calendar.html) to see when the next TopCoder SRMs and
Codeforces competitions will be held.

<br>

*Happy coding!*
