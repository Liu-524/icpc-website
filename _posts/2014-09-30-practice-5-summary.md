Last practice, we covered simulation problems from the past regionals. We went over 
one easy and one easy-moderate level problem.

<br>

Make sure you are comfortable solving simulation problems, as they are the most 
common problems in our region. You should be able to solve them quickly enough so 
that you can focus on harder problems.

<br>

At our next practice, we will go over graph algorithms, including search (BFS and 
DFS) and other general purpose algorithms (shortest path, minimum spanning tree, 
etc.).
