description: Summary of our sixth weekly practice of the Spring 2015 semester.
---

At today's practice, we discussed computational geometry, focusing on the problems from the 
[practice set](/announcements/2015/03/04/practice-problems-for-the-week-of-mar-03.html), 
most of which we went through in detail, including complete code.  We discussed 
various geometry formulas and algorithms, including convex hull. We also answered 
specific student questions and discussed some contest strategies.

<br/>

Next week, Mike will be going over intermediate graph algorithms, including shortest 
path and minimum spanning tree.
Problems will be posted by the end of the week. Until then, continue to work on any 
of the problems you have not yet finished from the last few content practices.

<br/>

Happy coding!
