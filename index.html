    <h2 class="title">The Competition</h2>
    <div>
      ICPC is the world's oldest and most prestigious algorithmic programming competition.
      During ICPC competitions, teams of three university students compete to solve as many challenging
      programming problems as they can within 5 hours. The tournament is separated
      into multiple stages; for US teams, it consists of a <b>Regionals</b> competition
      and the <b>World Finals</b>. The top
      teams in each region advance to the World Finals, which
      is held in a different country each year.

    <div>
      SIG-ICPC is for anyone who enjoys competitive programming or challenging
      algorithmic problems, but is particularly targeted towards those who
      want to do well in ICPC competitions. We meet every week to explain how to
      solve problems that appear in ICPC and other programming competitions and
      to practice solving challenging problems.
    </div>
    <div>
      You do not need to be a computer science student to participate in our
      practices or the ICPC competitions -- we welcome everyone who has an
      interest in learning algorithmic programming!
    </div>
    <div>
      In addition to helping in programming competitions, algorithmic
      problem-solving skills are incredibly helpful for technical interviews.
      Doing well in ICPC is also a great resume booster for getting a job at
      a top company.
